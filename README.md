# PanguOs
This is just a simple Ubuntu 20.04 distro that I have begun working on

# Whats on it
So far i have installed vaious applications which i do not own or have contributed into makeing, But is just here to make it easier for myself to install linux onto a new pc.

Node.js
Krita
godot
Atom
Wine, playOnLinux
Floxx
boxes
Spotify
Vim
BoscaCeoil
gnome tweaks
lightDk+gtk

and the base ubuntu programs that come with installation of ubuntu
These are just based on applications i would choose to install
I also removed some of the games and other gnome programms i wouldnt have any use for.

# Where is the iso
i have included all the files within the iso you should be able to download the files and pack them into an iso format.

# Where do i plan to take the OS?
I plan to make it more customized in the future but as this is my first sucessfully running distro i have only added applications to it for now however i intend to add many other unique aspects to the OS as i become more knowledgable in this subject
